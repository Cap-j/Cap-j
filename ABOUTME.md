I'm Julia, a soon-to-be DCU graduate currently looking for the next big step in my career.
I've completed a degree in Electronic and Computer engineering with a major in Systems and Devices. 

I have a passion for physics and maths, which I bring to life through code. Most of my coding experience is based on electronics projects and more recently, simulation software.
My best language is C++, although I also have experience in Python, Java, x86 Assembly and VHDL. As well as that, I'm proficient with OpenGL and OpenCV toolsets.
